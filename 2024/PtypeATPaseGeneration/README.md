Understanding and predicting the various conformational states of membrane proteins is crucial for uncovering their biological functions. Although computational methods have advanced, accurately modeling these complex structural transitions remains challenging.  
In this study, we present a novel method for predicting diverse functional states of membrane protein conformations using a diffusion model. Our approach combines forward and backward diffusion processes and integrates state classifiers and additional conditioners to modulate the generation gradient of conformational states. We focus on P-type ATPases, a key class of membrane transporters, for which we have curated and expanded a comprehensive structural dataset. Leveraging a graph neural network with a custom membrane constraint, our model generates accurate structures for P-type ATPases across different functional states.  
This method marks a significant advancement in computational structural biology and offers promising potential for studying the dynamics of other membrane proteins.

# Installation

To get started, ensure all dependencies are installed by running:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Our model is built on Chroma, so you'll need to register for an access token at [Chroma Weights](https://chroma-weights.generatebiomedicines.com/).

# Note: Due to GitHub's file size limitations (<25MB), the code provided here is incomplete. We plan to share the full code on Zenodo.
